# Go Meet PostgreSQL
This is a small wrapper for interacting with a Postgresql database in Go. You can also swap out the driver and connect this to another database, such as MSSQL. 

You can use it to SELECT and INSERT rows, and SHOW entire tables.

A simple command line interface has been implemented, however this is not essential for the wrappers use. 

`go run gomeetpostgresql.go`
